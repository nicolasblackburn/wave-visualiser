# wave-visualiser
A simple 2d wave visualiser in javascript

This little web application was programmed in 2012 and it allows you to explore and visualise 2d waves. The inspector and properties panels allow you to create or delete waves and change their properties in real time. The play button in the upper left corner of the screen animate the waves.
                
It has been programmed using javascript/jquery, HTML5 canvas, Bootstrap CSS and some custom CSS for the interface appearance. When looking back at the source code, I think I had a wider goal of creating some kind of generic web app skeleton, but I must have lost the interest after toying with it a bit. Still I like the look of it, and wave functions are cool!
                
Have fun,
